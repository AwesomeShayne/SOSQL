# Supplies Over Seas Capstone Project
This project is a collaboration between two Bioengineering capstone groups and the Nonprofit Supplies Over Seas(SOS). The two groups involved are Shipping Space Solutions(SSS) who's primary task is to produce a piece of software to automate solving how to fill a container with things to be shipped, and Supplies Over Seas Inventory Application Software(SOSIAS) who have been tasked with developing a method to handle inventory and the application process for requesting devices.
This project is done in collaboration, as storing a Database of inventory and handling different kindsof inventory are integral to both projects.
